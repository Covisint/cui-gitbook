# Conventions

In working with the framework, you will find a number of common conventions that are meant to make your life easier.

## Project Names

The common project naming convention as been to suggest `cui-{type}-{clientAcronym}`; for example, **cui-idm-acme** or **cui-i18n-acme** or **cui-styleguide-acme*

By using this convention, you'll know right away that the project is a CUI framework project, it is an idm based solution and for the ACME client.

## Repository Management

Keep your project in a git based repository if you can. Host it wherever you like (Gitlab, GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.) but seriously, use git as the basis if you can.

Take advantage of forks and branches, they won't bite and it really makes life a lot easier for your release manager!

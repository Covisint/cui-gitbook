## Description

Icon Library for Core Covisint UI Functionality

## Benefits
The CUI Icon library has curated a select set of icons that have specific meaning and purpose through the CUI visual language.  These icons have been curated and prepared for use as SVG icons and tested across the variety of devices and browsers supported by the framework.

Additionally, you'll find the entire font-awesome library is available for use as SVG format as well.

## Usage
It is _super_ easy to use any of the icons in the library in your CUI project.  You can simply use the `cui-icon` directive!

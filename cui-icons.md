# CUI Icons
Version 1.0


### Description
Icon Library for Core Covisint UI Functionality.

Along with the svg sprites used in the reference implementations of the cui products, in this repo we also provide the grunt task necessary for creating svg sprites.
The developer can then use the [cui-icon directive](cui-ng/directives/cui-icon) to easily access individual svgs from those sprites, in an angular app.

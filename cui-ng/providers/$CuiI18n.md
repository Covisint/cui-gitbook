# $CuiI18n Provider
Version 1.0

### Description
This provider serves a way of setting a list of prefered languages to use as fallback in case the internationalized name array does not have the language the user is currently using (served by the cui-i18n library). This will feed our [cuiI18n filter](cui-ng/filters/cuiI18n) and give it the information it needs to make the decision on which name to display.

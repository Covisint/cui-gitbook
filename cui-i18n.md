# CUI I18N
Version 1.0


### Description
Internationalization / localization module for use with angular on CUI products. Extracted from [angular-translate](https://github.com/angular-translate/angular-translate).

Based on a certain configuration (look at the repo for more info on this) allows to easily internationalize an app.

Allong with the angular module, in this repo we also provide a generator that creates the language .json (for javascript) and .properties (for java) based of a google spreadsheet.
